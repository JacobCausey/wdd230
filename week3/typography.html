      <h2>Heading Font:Cinzel </h2>
      <p>
        This font is very large and not that difficult to see, so it makes it
        visable to anyone that would be trying to find tabs, specific parts of
        the page, as well as having some sharp edges to try and make the page crisp.
      </p>

      <h2>Paragraph Font: Playfair Display</h2>
      <p>This font was similar to my heading fonts, and has clear defined characters.</p>
